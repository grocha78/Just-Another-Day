## Challenge
- Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day

## Purpose
- Familiarize oneself with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and Bootstrap

## Features
- When user visits page, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- When user scrolls down they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- When user clicks onto a time block they can enter an event and then click the save button for that time block
- The text for that event is then saved in local storage and after refreshing the page the saved events persist
